#Readme

This folder is intended to hold the coordinates of contours that you create
if you save them.

By default it also contains three files: "doe_john_years_25_bottom.txt",
"doe_john_years_25_median.txt" and "doe_john_years_25_upper.txt". These files
show you the file format that is used by viroconcom. Additonally, these files
are used by software tests.

The three files contain the coordinates of a contour that has been calculated
as part of the publication entitled "A Benchmarking Exercise on Estimating
Extreme Environmental Conditions: Methodology & Baseline Result" by A. F.
Haselsteiner and others, DOI: 10.1115/OMAE2019-96523 . The files are also
available at a public GitHub repository that was created together with this
publication: https://github.com/ec-benchmark-organizers/ec-benchmark/tree/
master/organizers-code/contour_coordinates
